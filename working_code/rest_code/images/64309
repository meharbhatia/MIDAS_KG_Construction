Norway has a lot of electric cars, so many that it can make anyone driving a new vehicle with an internal combustion engine look like a Luddite.
Mercedes-Benz brought us there to experience the EQC, and possibly to normalize it in a sea of EVs that makes California look like a land of late adopters.
Outside Oslo, where cars were larger and more upscale than in other parts of Europe, and Tesla vehicles are a more common sight than around Los Angeles or the Bay Area, the EQC fit right in.
DON'T MISS: Mercedes-Benz EQC Edition 1886 electric SUV kicks off a new era.
After a couple of rain-soaked days driving the EQC there last week, we can say that it will be a great addition in the U.S. when it arrives sometime in 2020.
At about 187 inches long, the EQC400 4Matic crossover splices into the American mid-sizers"
