## Updates are here ##


Regarding other datasets:

```icdm_contest_data.csv``` is default dataset

Clean dataset is a cleaned dataset :p it changes ```cars—so``` to ```cars — so``` and it changes ```... old_word_old_line.New_word_from_new_line ...``` to ```... old_word_old_line. New_word_from_new_line ...``` (notice the space)

```g050_Coref_Dataset.csv``` is a dataset with coreference resolution resolved using neuralcoref and greediness parameter set to ```0.50``` (which is default) Similarly ```g055_Coref_Dataset.csv``` has greediness = ```0.55```

```New_Coref_Dataset.csv``` is a dataset also set at greediness at ```0.50``` just the difference is, it is sentence segmented also.
