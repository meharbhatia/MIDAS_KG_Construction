13,"Announced earlier this week on Instagram, the collection comprises of a lip and face palette, three exclusive shades of the L’Absolu Mademoiselle Shine lipstick, a trio of the L’Absolu Lacquer lippie and a limited-edition Hypnôse Drama mascara — all designed with pink packaging and the winking eye motif signature to The Blonde Salad brand.“I wanted to create a makeup collection that is 100-percent my style,” Ferragni speaks of The Blonde Salad brand.“I new product launch in a press release.",cosmetics
13,“This is the reason why I joined forces with Lancôme.,cosmetics
13,"We worked on a product and communication that is relevant for the girls of my generation.”Drawing inspiration from Ferragni’s go-to makeup looks and action-packed lifestyle, the Flirting Palette is made up of four lipstick shades, four eyeshadows, one rosy blush, three shimmering highlighters, a lip gloss and three blushes, allowing beauty enthusiasts to create different looks according to generation.”Drawing inspiration from Ferragni’s go-to makeup looks and action-packed lifestyle mood.",cosmetics
13,"In addition to its attractive, glittery pink cover, the palette is also designed with a large mirror on the inside, making its a travel-friendly option.",cosmetics
14,"Every now and then, neon pops up as an inevitable yet invigorating fashion trend — one that feels irresistible for implementing into outfits in one way or another, whether it's a head-to-toe DayGlo suit or a just a bright bangle bracelet.",cosmetics
14,"But the last time neon looks started hitting the runway, Huda Kattan was struck with the desire for more than just fluorescent clothing and accessories.",cosmetics
14,"She was inspired to extend that summery, retro vibe to the face.",cosmetics
14,"The result: The founder and CEO of Huda Beauty developed a neon version of the brand's beloved nine-pan Obsessions palettes, aptly named Neon Obsessions Palettes.",cosmetics
14,And she spoke exclusively to Allure about them.“Neon was something I was really obsessed with for fashion.,cosmetics
14,"Normally my inspiration starts with what I want to wear on my face,"" Kattan tells Allure of Huda Beauty's existing makeup offerings, which while fully capable of creating bold looks, have arguably been made up of more neutral and traditional shades than what's found in the Pink, Orange, and Green Neon Obsessions Palettes.",cosmetics
14,"""But this time this time began with clothing and my fashion obsession.",cosmetics
14,I was obsessed with accessories like the vintage Chanel Lego bag and how the neon acrylic looked lit from within.,cosmetics
14,"I wanted to replicate it for the palette packaging and have that tie into the inspiration for the shades as well.""",cosmetics
15,The Cleansing Balm is also a multi-tasker.,cosmetics
15,"It works as a moisturizing daily cleanser, a deeply hydrating overnight mask, and as an aptly described ""melting makeup-removing balm.""",cosmetics
15,"But unlike other infamous multitaskers like three-in-one shampoo, body wash, and conditioner hybrids that wind up falling short on all accounts, this isn't a Pyrrhic victory.",cosmetics
15,It has worked well for me in all forms.,cosmetics
15,"In terms of cons, the Cleansing Balm is expensive for a skincare product, isn't the most travel-friendly size, and, depending on your skin and makeup routine, probably won't be the one skincare product you need for clear, well-nourished skin.",cosmetics
15,"Since it's a balm, I typically use a dual-cleansing routine if I wear makeup to make sure I don't leave any residue behind or impede upon the Balm's ability to nourish my skin directly.",cosmetics
15,"If you typically wear thick foundation and plan to only use the Cleansing Balm, you may need to go over the Cleansing Balm with a wash cloth or cotton pad a couple of times to make sure you're not leaving any residue behind.",cosmetics
16,"Before her royal wedding to Prince Harry, Duchess Meghan spilled many of her secrets to Beauty Banter, and we’re still so impressed with Duchess Meghan picks.",cosmetics

16,"“No more raccoon eyes,” one said, while another said another even stayed perfectly put after a shower!",cosmetics
16,Now that’s impressive.,cosmetics
16,"One reviewer said this was a “‘have to have’ cosmetic” and we agree wholeheartedly!This liner has a “gentle, soft, silicone-enriched formula” and may apply completely smooth with no tugs or scratches in sight.",cosmetics
16,"Even if the tip starts getting a little dull, all we need to do is detach the sharpener on the opposite end and give the sharpener a little twist!",cosmetics
16,Just like new.,cosmetics
17,"Speaking of twists, this eyeliner is actually retractable, so all we need to do is twist to make this eyeliner appear or disappear.",cosmetics
17,"Retractable tips are our favorite, partially because our can’t lose the cap if there isn’t one in the first place, but also because it keeps our liner safe from dust, dirt and any accidental smushing!This Stylo Yeux liner comes in a super wide range of shades.",cosmetics

18,")For years, I’d been using eyeliners from prestige brands simply because the color selection was better, so I was pretty jazzed to find a fun collection of liners at a reasonable price.",cosmetics
18,"I don’t generally spend a lot on eye makeup simply because it has such a short shelf life, so I was happy to spend $4 on an eyeliner rather than $20+.I instantly fell for the teal liner from the Silkissime collection and was excited to see that it was just as effective as it was pretty.",cosmetics
18,"The silky pencil glides on like a dream, and the smooth consistency doesn’t tug at my eyelid like most sharper pencils do.",cosmetics
18,"To be honest, I’m still perfecting my cat eye, so I tend to go for gel and pencil liners — liquid liner is not my friend!",cosmetics
