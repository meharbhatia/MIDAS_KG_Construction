Macon-Bibb commissioners voted on the 2020 budget. It doesn’t include a millage rate increase or pay raises to any county employee. Commissioners said they promised citizens they wouldn’t raise taxes three years in a row, and they’re sticking to the promise in the approved $164.5-million budget. Two commissioners say, the budget didn’t address all needs. “Trying to work out a situation where we can give not bonuses cause it’s illegal to give bonuses but to give funds to our deputies, to our firefighters, and to all employees that would happen in December,” Commissioner Joe Allen said. With no raise in taxes for residents, means no pay raises for public safety and county employees.

It is an important factor and certainly we’ll be back next year,” Sheriff David Davis said. This year, the county is conducting surveys to evaluate employees to determine what they should be getting paid. Mayor Robert Reichert said the surveys will determine how much employees should get paid, so next year they can discuss raises.
